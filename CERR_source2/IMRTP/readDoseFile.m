function [dose_pb]=readDoseFile(filename, precision, nr, nc, ns)
%"readDoseFile"
%   Read in a .dos file produced by VMC++ and return the dose vector.
%   Filename is the .dos file, precision is 2 or 4 indicating dose byte
%   precision, nr/nc/ns are the dimensions of the scan.  The scan may be a 
%   subset of the orignal depending on how the .dos files were generated.

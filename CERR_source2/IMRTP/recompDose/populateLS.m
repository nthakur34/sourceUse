function populateLS(planC_File, Leakage_flag)
%function populateLS()
%
%This function calculates Leaf sequences and populates IM.LeafSeq object
%It should be invoked after optimizing beamletWeights.
%Assumes Beamlet Weights are stored under planC{indexS.IM}(end).IMDosimetry.solution(end).beamletWeights
%
%planC_File: is the name of CERR plan.

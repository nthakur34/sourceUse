function indexV = KonRadCube(indexV, size)
%"KonRadCube"
%   Convert voxels indexed using the CERR method to KonRad.
%
%   CERR uses matlab matrix indexing, (row,col,slice) where the first row is
%   anterior, the first column is to the patient's right, and the first slice
%   is the most superior.
%
%   (I think) KonRad uses (x,y,z) indexing where the first x is to the patient's right,
%   the first y is posterior, and the first z is the most inferior.

%function [gantryVectorsM] = RTOGVectors2Gantry(RTOGVectorsM, gantryAngle)
%Convert from RTOG unit vectors to gantry unit vectors (IEC 1217 coord system).
% RTOGVectorsM has columns: i, j, and k components.
% gantryVectorsM are the vectors in the gantry frame, defined by IEC 1217.
% gantryAngle is the phig gantry angle defined by IEC 1217.
% The current assumption is that the couch angle is zero.

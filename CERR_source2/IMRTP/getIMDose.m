function [dose3D] = getIMDose(IM, PBWeightsV, structsV)
%Create 3D dose matrix from PB weigths (PBWeightsV) and
%a list of structures to have dose computed to (structsV).
%JOD, 14 Nov 03.
%JRA, 27 Feb 04.
%JOD, 6 Sept 05, added single string option to replace structsV,
%e.g., 'skin'. If structsV is a single str, just show dose for that structure.
%JOD, 20 Dec 05, small mods for speed.
%JJW, 20 Jun 06, MCflag removed

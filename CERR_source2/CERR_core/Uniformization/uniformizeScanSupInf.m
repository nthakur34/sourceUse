%"uniformizeScanSupInf"
%    Creates the superior and inferior scan arrays so that they 
%   are uniform, consistent with the rest of the scan array.
%
%Latest modifications:
% 16 Aug 02, V H Clark, first version.
% 09 Apr 03, JOD, added hBar to input parameter list.
% 18 Feb 05, JRA, Added support for multiple scans.
%
%Usage:
%   function planC = uniformizeScanSupInf(planC, tMin, tMax, optS, hBar)

function [xVals, yVals, zVals] = getUniformScanXYZVals(scanStruct)
%"getUniformScanXYZVals"
%   Return the X Y and Z vals of the uniformized scan from the passed
%   scanStruct.
%
%   These are arrays, with a value for each row, col and slice in the
%   uniformized dataset.
%
%   In case of any error accessing the data 0 is returned for all vals.

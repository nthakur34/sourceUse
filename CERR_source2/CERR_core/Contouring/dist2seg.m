function [d, flag] = dist2seg(r0V, r1V, r2V)
%Return the shortest distance from the point
%given by the two-d vector r0V to the line segment whose
%endpoints are given by the two-d vectors r1V and r2V.
%If the shortest distance is to the first endpoint, flag = -1;
%if to the second endpoint, flag = 1;
%if to the perpindicular, flag = 0.

%1.  Compute the cosine between the line and the vector
%    from r2V to r0V.
%2.  compute the distance to the perpindicular.

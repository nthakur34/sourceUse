function rasterSegs = StructMargin(rasterSegs1, margin, scanNum, planC)
%Returns a 2D margin of size <margin> cm, around the border of the
%structure specified by rasterSegs1.  Example: if the source structure
%is a filled in circle, the output is a donut with width margin*2.
%The circle's edge was expanded.

function rasterSegs = structIntersect(rasterSegs1, rasterSegs2, scanNum, planC)
%"structIntersect"
%   Find the intersect between two structures given their entire set of
%   rasterSegments.  Performs this intersect one slice at a time to save
%   memory.

%   By JRA 10/1/03
%
%   rasterSegs1    : rasterSegments of first structure
%   rasterSegs2    : rasterSegments of second structure
%   scanNum        : scanNumber that both sets of rasterSegs are defined on
%   planC          : CERR planC
%
%   rasterSegs     : rasterSegments of intersect of structures 1 & 2.

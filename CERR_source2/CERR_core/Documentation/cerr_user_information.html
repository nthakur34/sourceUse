<P ALIGN=Left>
<OL>
  <LI>
    02 Aug 04.   2.5 b2 released.  Fixed a bug with the DICOM import dictionary and associated code.
  <LI>
    23 July 04.  2.5 released. IMRT problem creation module added.  CERR viewer GUI overhauled.
    Many small bug fixes and changes.
  <LI>
    4 November 03.  2.1 released.  Additions: Dose shadow tool, structure combination 
    tool, DICOM import in Matlab6.5 using DICOM-RT Toolbox by Emiliano Spezi 
    (not incl in compiled version), Unified structure under CERR.m, labbook tool to store
    and annotate CERR images. 
    Improvements: increased slice change speed, increased 3D speed, slice image caching, 
    generally lower memory usage, bug fixes for compatibility with Matlab 6.1. Also correct
    inconsistent zValues in plans to be imported.
  <LI>
    14 October 03.  Replaced buggy deduceVoxelThickness file with corrected version.
  <LI>
    25 August 03.  Fixed bug with using Matlab 6.1 involving && operator.
    Added doseCutoff by clicking colorbar or entering field.  
  <LI>
    30 June 03, 2.00 released.  Additions: dose subraction tools, DVHComparison to
    highlight differences between DVHs, montage slice preview window, beta dose 
    comparison metrics, CTwindow level preset.  Made necessary changes to 
    compile standalone under x86.  Made recommended optimizations to increase 
    slice redraw speed.  (Thanks to Nathan Childress).
  <LI>
    20 May 03, bug in findAndSetMinCTSpacing.m found &amp; fixed by Emiliano
    Spezi. &nbsp;Fixed another bug fixed in findAndSetMinCTSpacing.m which was
    giving the (potentially) wrong slice thickness to the uniformized CT slices.
    &nbsp;Fixed a bug in the anonymize_script which was resulting in losing the
    CERROptions from import stored in planC, later resulting in losing sagittal
    and coronal images on display. &nbsp;Regenerated the head and neck and lung
    example archives to correct this (prostate example was already anonymized).
  <LI>
    9 May 03, 2.00b6 released. &nbsp;fixed DVH bug when voxel sample rate is
    not zero. &nbsp;Fixed bug that assumed that CT slice thicknesses were appropriate
    for voxel widths. &nbsp;Now voxel widths are computed separately, and used
    for DVH calculations. &nbsp;key-word 'dose scale' now used in importing dose
    distribution if optS.useDoseScale = 'yes'. &nbsp;Fixed bug when uniformized
    datasets are determined at runtime. &nbsp;Added CERR import version to header
    file. &nbsp;The CERR version will hereafter be kept in CERRCurrentVersion.m.
    &nbsp;New example CERR archives were generated due to inaccuracies in original
    determinations of voxel volumes and positions.
  <LI>
    7 May 03, fixed bug in pad.m utility.
  <LI>
    1 May 03, versions 2.00b5 released. &nbsp;Bug fix to get DVHs correct on
    when superior and inferior dose slices coincide with CT slices. &nbsp;Added
    'dose' command line command. &nbsp;Fixed archive filename limitation.
    &nbsp;Added user-defined command line capability (see command line options,
    below).
  <LI>
    version b4. &nbsp;30 Apr 03. &nbsp;Tested import from Helax-TMS v. 6.
    &nbsp;Successful with minor fixups. &nbsp;Also added support for doseScale
    keyword. &nbsp;doseArray is scaled by doseScale upon import (default is 1).
    &nbsp;Also added routine to deduce slice thicknesses if only z values are
    given. &nbsp;Provably correct assuming that first slice thickness equals
    the difference between the first two z values. &nbsp;Also added support for
    widely varying archive names, such as RTOG_000.dat, so long as '000' is present.
    &nbsp;Successful import from CMS Xeo.
  <LI>
    version b3. &nbsp;23 Apr 03. &nbsp;Fixed uniformized CT bug as previously
    listed in bug fix list. &nbsp;Added uint16 support for scan uniformization
    and also allow backwards compatibility with previously created CERR archives.
    &nbsp;Also, directories with files which are not completely tested are listed
    with a 'Beta' postfix.
  <LI>
    17 Apr 03. &nbsp;Version is now 2.00b2. &nbsp;Postfix number will now increment
    for any code changes.
  <LI>
    8 April 03. &nbsp;This version has multiple changes, including: &nbsp;(a)
    a 3-D volumetric viewer for anatomical structures and dose distributions.
    &nbsp;Type '3D' at the command line to use it. (b) Bug fix wherein the z
    slice spacing was erroneously assumed to be uniform for the purpose of DVH
    calculations. (c) minor style fixes in some gui elements. &nbsp;(d) addition
    of a new function ...\CERR\Extras\puttingNewDose\dose2CERR.m which can be
    used to put a new dose distribution back into CERR for analysis. &nbsp;A
    test function, ...CERR\Extras\puttingNewDose\test_dose2CERR.m shows how to
    use this. (e) minor bugfix to sliceCallBack. (f) modification to CT
    uniformization code so that the slice width is more controllable (see
    CERROptions.m file or options table below for more information).

<OL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Severity 3. &nbsp;Some old plans without raster segments or uniformized data may
    not function properly in functions that require this data.  Raster segments should
    be dynamically generated but uniformized data will not.  Fix will be released soon.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>

<A NAME="requirements"><!-- --></A><BIG><BIG>System and software
requirements</BIG></BIG>
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;What version of Matlab do I need?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. CERR works with Matlab ver. 6.5 and has (nearly) bug-free operation with
ver. 6.1. &nbsp;CERR does not require any 'Toolboxes'. (Except for DICOM import, which requires the Image Processing Toolbox.) &nbsp;CERR will not
work with Matlab ver. 5 as it uses ver. 6 data structures.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;What systems does it run on? &nbsp;
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. &nbsp;This release only runs on Matlab and Windows NT, 2000, or XP  and LINUX.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;How much memory do I need? &nbsp;
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. &nbsp;To operate comfortably, we estimate that you will need memory equal
to the archive size you want to view plus at least 100 MB.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;What systems has CERR successfully imported from?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. &nbsp;(1) &nbsp;NOMOS Peacock (2) ADAC Pinnacle (3) MIR old 3D system
(4) HELAX - TMS V. 6. &nbsp;(5) Computerized Medical Systems, Inc., XiO.
&nbsp;We are trying to grow this list. &nbsp;Please contact us if you have
another academic or commercial system which you would like to try.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<A NAME="installation"><!-- --></A><BIG><BIG>Installation and quick start
instructions</BIG></BIG>
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. How do I&nbsp;install CERR?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. Unzip the CERR program archive. Then put it on your path using the usual
setpath GUI (BE SURE TO ADD ALL SUBDIRECTORIES) or command line path tool in Matlab.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. How do I view stored CERR archives?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. Type 'CERR', File->Open, Navigate to the archive and click Open.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;How do I close CERR?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. Close the viewer window in the usual way for that operating
system. &nbsp;All the other CERR windows should close automatically, except for
the CERR main menu.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Up/Down arrow keys will change the slice for the currently selected view (transverse,
sagittal or coronal).
<P ALIGN=Left>
Changing slices on the transverse view, with the colorwash option and the
structures and scan on, takes about one second on a fast (2 GHz) PC for 
512x512 plans and .25 seconds for 256x256.  Cached slices display much faster.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Many of the program options are described and set in the file CERROptions.m.
&nbsp;The options and their selectable values are documented there. This
file is automatically loaded&nbsp;when CERRSliceViewer is invoked. You can
change any options and reload them by issuing the 'reload options' command
at the transverse viewer command line, and then selecting the (possibly
different) options file desired.

<A NAME="importing"><!-- --></A><BIG><BIG>Importing RTOG/DICOM archives</BIG></BIG>
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. How do I read in and convert an AAPM/RTOG or DICOM archive formatted directory
into CERR format?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. RTOG: First look at the file CERROptions.m. In the section labeled 'importing'
are several self-explanatory options concerning what will be read in, etc.
Then type 'CERR' and click File->Import...->RTOG.  Then select the aapm0000 (or other '000') file to get
started. After conversion, you will be asked what to name the resulting file
and whether to compress the archive.
<P ALIGN=Left>
DICOM: CERR can now import via the DICOM-RT mechanism (in Matlab 6.5) using Emiliano Spezi's DICOM-RT
toolbox. Type 'CERR' and click File->Import...->DICOM.  Then select a directory to scan for DICOM files.
Once the scan is complete a text prompt will ask what studies/scans/doses to import.
See DICOM-RT-toolbox-v2/docs directory for more information.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<A NAME="compression"><!-- --></A><BIG><BIG>About compressed
archives</BIG></BIG>
<P ALIGN=Left>
Why does CERR use compression with bzip2? &nbsp;Because it can save up to
90% of disk space (for 256 x 256 CT scan images, somewhat less for plans
with standard 512 x 512 CT scan sets). This is significantly more than what
zip or gzip gives.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;I opened a compressed archive in CERR and it is now uncompressed.
I would like a compressed version. How can I get it?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. Select the 'Save' button on the transverse slice viewer. It will ask you
if you want to compress the archive.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;I opened a .bz2 (bzipped) CERR archive, but now it has disappeared.
What happened?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. The current default behavior is to unzip and create the corresponding
.mat file. The assumption is that the compressed file is primarily for transfer,
and it will be more convenient to have the unzipped version for actual use.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;I tried to create a new compressed archive, but it failed. Why?
&nbsp;
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. &nbsp;Compression will fail if a compressed archive with the same name
already eixsts in the target directory. &nbsp;Look for a message to this
effect on the console. We feel this is safer than automatically overwriting
an existing directory (which is the only other option).
<P ALIGN=Left>
<A NAME="viewer"><!-- --></A><BIG><BIG>About the CERR Viewer</BIG></BIG>
<P ALIGN=Left>
The CERR viewer defaults to a 4 panel view: one large Transverse, and a small Sag, Cor, and Legend.  To change the number and size of the panels click View->Panel Layout, and select a preset layout.
<P ALIGN=Left>
To swap one panel with another, select a panel with the mouse (its label will turn red) and double click on another panel.
<P ALIGN=Left>
To change slices, use the Up/Down arrow keys (except in Linux), the S+ S- buttons in the left margin, or click and drag the plane locators in the Trans/Sag/Cor Views.  Plane locators may be toggled off from the View menu.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Zoom mode can be toggled by clicking the 'Zoom Mode' button in the left margin.  Left click zooms in, Right click zooms out, and dragging a box zooms into an area of interest.  Double click returns to full zoomed out.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Structure contours can be toggled on/off by clicking a structure name in the legend, or by selecting its name in the Structures Menu.
<P ALIGN=Left>
A ruler can be raised by clicking the Ruler checkbox in the left margin and dragging a line segment in any axis.  The origin, end point and distance are displayed in red in the CERR Status line at the bottom of the screen.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Dose transparency can be set by dragging the Dose----Scan slider.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Dose display cutoff can be set by clicking the colorbar at the desired level or by typing the dose in the textbox below the colorbar.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<A NAME="doseDisplay"><!-- --></A><BIG><BIG>About dose display</BIG></BIG>
<P ALIGN=Left>
There are three principle methods of dose display (see table of options):
<OL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Isodose lines.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Colorwash.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Visual reference colorwash. &nbsp;This is a colorwash where the colormap
    is rescaled for every new dose distribution: &nbsp;doses above a visual reference
    dose are shown in inverted gray scale (black the highest dose, white the
    reference dose), whereas doses below that level are shown in another colormap.
    &nbsp;This orients the viewer as to what doses are above some 'prescription'
    reference.
</OL>
<P ALIGN=Left>
CERR is currently not very fast at slice paging to the next dose display:
&nbsp;when colorwash is on on, it takes about 1 second to change slices on
a 2 GHz Pentium IV machine. &nbsp;We have made efforts, though limited, to
speed up slice paging. &nbsp;Faster computers will make this unirritating
fast, even on laptops (well, in a few years). &nbsp;Alternatively, sophisticated
methods could be used to speed things up, such as more compiled code, or
'look ahead' computing in preparation for the next slice before the user
requests it, etc.  UPDATE: we have made good progress in speeding up paging.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<A NAME="Contouring"><!-- --></A><BIG><BIG>Contouring anatomical
structures</BIG></BIG>
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;How do I contour a new or old structure?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. CERR contains a relatively complete set of contouring tools under the
assumption that new anatomical regions may need to be defined or previous
geometrical definitions may need to be adjusted.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The typical contouring process is as follows:
<OL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    From the 'Structures' pull-down menu on the transverse slice viewer, choose
    'Contouring'
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    The left margin populates with contouring controls.  Select the contour to edit from the dropdown box, or click New Structure to start a new contour.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    NOTE: Contouring can only be performed in the transverse panel.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Any existing contours appear blue on the transverse slice.  To select an existing contour, right click it. Selected contours appear red.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Selected contours can be deleted by clicking 'Delete selected contour'.  To replace a portion of a selected contour, click and drag to draw a line from one point on the contour to another.  Right click to cycle through the various combinations of the old contour and new segment.  Left click when Finished to finalize the contour.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Copy +Z/-Z copies all contours from the selected structure one slice above/below the current slice.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    To save all changes made since contouring started and exit contouring mode, click Save.  To revert all changes, click cancel.
</OL>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<A NAME="dvh"><!-- --></A><BIG><BIG>Dose volume histograms</BIG></BIG>
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;How are dose volume histograms computed?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. &nbsp;Each CT voxel has associated with it a volume equal to it's cuboid
volume. &nbsp;Voxel widths in the z direction are determined to leave no
gaps between CT slices. &nbsp;Half the inter-slice space belongs to the voxel
of the next slice and half belongs to the voxel of the last slice. &nbsp;We
do this even on the 'end cap' slices which are the most superior and inferior
of the defined volume of interest. &nbsp;Dose is linearly interpolated to
the voxel center in the slice plane. &nbsp;Thus determined, the doses and
volumes are histogrammed up. If the option ROISampleRate is not equal to
1, voxels are re-weighted to higher volumes. &nbsp;Generally, the DVH calculator
is fast enough to leave ROISampleRate = 1.
<P ALIGN=Left>
How do I plot a dose-volume histogram (DVH)?
<P ALIGN=Left>
Steps:
<OL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Click Metrics->DVH from the CERR Menubar.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    On the DVH menu window, all the previously stored DVHs will be listed in
    color.

The 3-D viewer menu can be raised by entering '3D', or '3-D' or '3-d' in
the command line. &nbsp;The menu has boxes for selecting structures to be
included, as well as transparency factors (0 is completely transparent and
1 is completely opaque). &nbsp;There is a line to select a dose level to
be shown as well. &nbsp;An 'L'-shaped object defines directions: &nbsp;the
red bar points up and the green bar points to the patients left (assuming
a head-to-feet scan position). &nbsp;Currently, the 3-D viewer downsamples
images to 128 x 128 in the transverse plane. &nbsp;To rotate the image, select
the 'move camera' option from the figure's &nbsp;'tools' menu. &nbsp;Then
grab the figure with mouse button 1 to rotate it.&nbsp;

A tool to view the projection of dose within a given structure can be accessed by clicking
metrics, Dose Shadow and selecting a structure.  The max, min, and mean values along every column
of pixels within the selected structure is calculated and displayed.  The user can then easily see
hot or cold spots and can query the dose at a point selected with the mouse.

<P ALIGN=Left>
<A NAME="DoseSubtract"><!-- --></A><BIG><BIG>Dose Subtraction </BIG></BIG>
<P ALIGN=Left>
The difference between two doses may be calculated, in order to better visualize what
regions one dose effects that another does not.  Select dose distributions in the 
transverse viewer's menubar and choose Dose Subtraction.  Select the two doses to
be subtracted.  The new dose is calculated and stored as (FirstDose - SecondDose),
which is displayed in the current window.  Dose colors displayed with diagonal hatching 
are negative, and represent dose included in SecondDose but not FirstDose.  Dose colors
without hatching represent dose included in FirstDose but not SecondDose.  DVHs may be 
calculated on the difference between two doses, though the max/min/mean values will not
reflect reality.  The dose arrays must be the same size and have corresponding elements.

<P ALIGN=Left>
<A NAME="Metrics"><!-- --></A><BIG><BIG>Metrics </BIG></BIG>
<P ALIGN=Left>
A beta tool to compare metrics graphically is included in this version of CERR.
Select metrics in the transverse viewer's menubar and choose Metric Comparison.
The left hand box contains a list of available metrics.  Choose a metric by double 
clicking it or clicking and using the add arrow.  Edit a metric's parameters 
in the right hand listbox.  After the desired metrics have been chosen and their
parameters defined, select the doses to be compared by the metrics and click Evaluate.
After the metric's values are calculated, a graphical comparison of the doses is displayed.

A tool to combine, expand or contract structures can be accessed by clicking structures
on the toolbar and selecting "derive new structure".  Choose an operation on the left,
either Union, intersect, subtraction, expansion by x cm or contraction by x cm.  Then 
select the appropriate number of structures from the right.  An intermediate structure
will appear which can then be used to create structures composed of nested expressions.
When you have a function you are happy with and want to add it to the plan, click GO and
then click that structure.

<P ALIGN=Left>
All treatment plan information is contained in the cell-array typically named
'planC.' &nbsp;As an example of accessing of the CERR plan object, the command
<P ALIGN=Left>
planC{4}(1).contour(27).segments.points
<P ALIGN=Left>
returns, in this case, the points associated with the first (only) segment
of the first contour on the 27th slice. See the CERRSliceViewer code for
many more examples of how to properly access information stored in CERR format.
&nbsp;
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;How can I get access to the underlying plan archive data in Matlab?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. You can either load the archive file or start CERRSliceViewer. &nbsp;To
load it as a .mat file, just use the usual 'load *.mat' command. After loading
(with or without the GUI) type 'global planC' at the Matlab prompt. planC{end}
gives the index to where (and what) things are stored in the cell array.
&nbsp;General 'state' information is stored in the global variable stateS.
&nbsp;Type 'global stateS' for access.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;Where are things stored in the plan archive?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. &nbsp;The different cells of the cell array contain data objects according
to the value of the structure indexS which is loaded from initializeCERR.m.
For example we have:
<P ALIGN=Left>
indexS.header = 1;
<P ALIGN=Left>
indexS.comment = 2;
<P ALIGN=Left>
indexS.scan = 3;
<P ALIGN=Left>
indexS.structures = 4;
<P ALIGN=Left>
indexS.structuresArray = 5;
<P ALIGN=Left>
indexS.beamGeometry = 6;
<P ALIGN=Left>
indexS.dose = 7;
<P ALIGN=Left>
indexS.DVH = 8;
<P ALIGN=Left>
indexS.digitalFilm = 9;
<P ALIGN=Left>
indexS.CERROptions = 10;
<P ALIGN=Left>
indexS.indexS = 11;
<P ALIGN=Left>
This means that the scan information is all contained in the 3rd element
of the scan (planC{3}), the dose information is all contained in the 7th
element, etc. The import options are all stored in cell 10 (however, the
user may change them during execution), and cell 11 contains this list of
cell contents. &nbsp;This index is always stored as the last element in planC.
&nbsp;Hence, we always have
<P ALIGN=Left>
indexS = planC{end}
<P ALIGN=Left>
New elements can be added to any plan archive merely by redefining the field
values of planC{end}, and moving the cell array elements around accordingly.

Q. &nbsp;Can I add arbitrary new fields to structures without breaking any
code?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. &nbsp;Yes, without exception.

<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;How can I learn how CERR works?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. &nbsp;Matlab has a fantastic debugger which can be used to great advantage.
&nbsp;Following Matlab's instructions, set desired break points and watch
changes to, say, the transverse slice viewer as each command is executed.
&nbsp;The debugger has many features as described in the Matlab manual.
&nbsp;Also, the global structure variable stateS contains a great deal of
state information. &nbsp;Type 'global stateS' to make it available. &nbsp;All
figure handles are stored under stateS.handle...&nbsp;&nbsp;
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;How can I tell which functions call which other functions?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. We wrote a Matlab function, coded by Vanessa Clark, to produce a detailed
cross-listing of the code: /CrossListing/getDirFunInfo.m. See the current
cross-lising under: /CrossListing/. &nbsp;The cross-listing is about 9,000
lines long and lists which functions call which other functions along with
all the variables of each m-file. &nbsp;Note that getDirFunInfo.m&nbsp;can
be re-run at any time. &nbsp;Here is an example of its use:
<P ALIGN=Left>
getDirFunInfo('c:\tmp\cerr_30dec02_cross_listing.txt', 'y', 'CERR Cross Listing',
'e:\cerr\cerr_current')
<P ALIGN=Left>
<A NAME="coding"><!-- --></A><BIG><BIG>Coding conventions</BIG></BIG>
<P ALIGN=Left>
Meaningful variable and function names are used wherever possible. The naming
convention is 'small/large caps,' whereby the first letter of a variable
name is not capitalized unless it is an abbreviation (e.g., CT). Hence, we
use variables like sizeOfDimension1, etc.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Typically, though not always, the last letter is capitalized and used to
distinguish data object types:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    varV (and sometimes var) means the data object is a 1-D vector.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    varM means the data object is a 2-D matrix
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    var3M means the data object is a 3-D matrix
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    varA means that the data object is a multidimensional array
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    varS means the data object is a structure
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    varC means the data object is a cell array
</UL>
<P ALIGN=Left>
A few data objects are passed around as global variables. This facilitates
interactive use with Matlab: typing global planC gives the Matlab user access
to a plan being viewed using the CERRSliceViewer tool. However, it may have
drawbacks in the future because any part of the program may modify any part
of the treatment plan.
<P ALIGN=Left>
When selecting some cell of planC, please use indexS as the indexer, e.g.,
'planC{indexS.scan}' instead of 'planC{3}.' The actual indices may change
in the future to accommodate more cell elements. If the indexS structure
is always used then more elements can be added, and others moved, with a
trivial modification to the initial value of indexS.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Modifications to working source code are logged briefly near the top of the
m-file.

Q. &nbsp;How can I 'anonymize' a treatment plan archive to remove protected
health information?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. See the function anonymize.m under /Extras/Anonymize/. Be sure to identify
all the fieldnames that may contain protected health information. &nbsp;Of
course, we make no guarantees about the results.&nbsp;
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;How do I change dose distributions?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. Just select the new dose distribution from the 'Dose distribution' pull
down menu on the transverse viewer.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;What does 'scan uniformization' and the Uniformization
subdirectory&nbsp;refer to?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. This is the process of building a CT dataset with uniform axial (z) spacing.
This is useful for sagittal and coronal viewing and will be useful for future
projects such as dose computation. The uniformized scan set has a uniform
axial (z) spacing and the same transverse resolution as the normal CT-scan
(usually, but not always, 512 x 512). Superior and inferior 'bookends' will
be created in addition, via 3-D linear interpolation, to complete the uniformized
CT dataset. Encoded masks (0/1) of structure locations are stored registered
to this uniformized dataset. &nbsp;Given a set of CT values, we choose the
largest block which CT slice spacing which falls within the limits of
optS.lowerLimitUniformCTSliceSpacing and optS.upperLimitUniformCTSliceSpacing.
&nbsp;Otherwise we create a set with a spacing equal to
optS.alternateUniformCTSliceSpacing. If the user desires a uniformized scan
with a spacing of exactly optS.alternateUniformCTSliceSpacing, then set
optS.lowerLimitUniformCTSliceSpacing to be larger than
optS.upperLimitUniformCTSliceSpacing.

<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. &nbsp;Is there an email mailing list for CERR? &nbsp;
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;We have created a yahoo groups mailing list and archive
for users of CERR.&nbsp;&nbsp;Send me an email and I will put you on it.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. Will the documentation get better?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. Yes, but the timetable is undocumented.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Q. Will CERR bugs get fixed?
<P ALIGN=Left>
A. Yes they will -- including those to make the import tool work for a wider
variety of planning systems. &nbsp;It is often the case that vendors don't
follow the RTOG specification exactly. &nbsp;We have always been able to
correct (i.e. translate) or workaround variant implementations.

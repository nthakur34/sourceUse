function ans = calc_MOHx(doseBinsV, volsHistV, percent,tail)
% Returns the mean dose of the upper tail (the hottest x% of the structure)
% given the DVH data and the parameter percent.

%  Created: VHC 4/11/06, based off of calc_Dx code, 
%  IME modified 04/17/06
%  VHC modified 11/20/06, changed from calc_mDx to calc_MOHx
%
%  Usage: calc_MOHx(doseBinsV, volsHistV, percent)

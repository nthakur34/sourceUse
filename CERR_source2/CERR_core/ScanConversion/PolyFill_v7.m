function maskM = PolyFill_v7(pointsM,optS)
%function maskM = PolyFill_v7(pointsM,optS)
%fastPoly_v7: returns a matrix maskM of size [numRows,numCols],
%[numRows,numCols] are passed via optS.
%numRows = imageSizeV(1); numCols = imageSizeV(2);
%where, imageSizeV = optS.ROIImageSize;
%Intention is to only fill a voxel if it's center is inside or 
%on the polygon edges.
%Uses MATLAB built-in function 'inpolygon'.

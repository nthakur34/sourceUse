function [repairedM, flag] = repairContour(edgeM, optS, offsetV)
%This function fixes the problem of small overlaps
%in contours.  It works by 'excision repair' a la
%DNA excision repair: all regions
%between edges which cross - including the crossing edges,
%are snipped out, and the ends are rejoined in a straight
%line.

%Latest modifications:  11 Mar 02, JOD.
%                  23 Jan 03, JOD, replaced wavelet toolbox routine wshift with vshift.
%                                  Also, made startIDV a double array instead of logical.  This
%                                  fixed a bug when there were two
%                                  excisions on the same contour.

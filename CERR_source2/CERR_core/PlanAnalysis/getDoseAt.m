function dosesV = getDoseAt(doseNum, xV, yV, zV, planC)
%"getDoseAt"
%   Returns the dose at the points defined by vectors xV, yV, zV, in the
%   requested doseNum.  The doseOffset is included, if it exists.  
%
%   Any transM values are NOT included.  If the transformed dose is wanted,
%   pass xV,yV,zV through applyTransM.
%
%   If planC isn't specified, the global planC is used.
%
%LM: 02 May 03, JOD, first version.  Based on getDVH.m.
%    24 Feb 05, JRA, Modified header, now using some subfunctions. 
%                    Also updated for new finterp3.
%
%Usage:
%   dosesV = getDoseAt(doseNum, xV, yV, zV, planC)

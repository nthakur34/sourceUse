function sig = calcDoseSignature(doseIndex, planC)
%"calcDoseSignature"
%   Returns a signature to identify a dose distribution, for the purpose of
%   flagging DVHs as stale once the stored signature does not match an
%   existing dose distribution.
%
%   Currently uses the dose sum and the linear position of the
%   maxdose.  Some CRC signature may be possible in the future, if fast
%   code is available.

function [isStale, planC] = findStaleDVHs(planC)
%"findStaleDVHs"
%   Find calculated DVHs stored in planC that were generated from doses
%   that no longer exist.  Stale DVHs are defined as those without the
%   "doseSignature" field, or those that do have the field but it's
%   contents do not match the signature of any existing doses.
%
%   isStale is a boolean vector, with 1 if the DVH is stale.
%
%   Confirmed stale DVHs have the doseSignature field set to [].

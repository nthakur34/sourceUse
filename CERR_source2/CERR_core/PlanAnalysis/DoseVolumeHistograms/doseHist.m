function [doseBinsV, volsHistV] = doseHist(doseV, volsV, binWidth)
%"doseHist"
%   Put the dose values into individual histogram bins.  doseV is a list of
%   dose values and volsV is a list of corresponding volumes for each value
%   in doseV.  
%
%   binWidth is the desired width of a single bin in doseBinsV.

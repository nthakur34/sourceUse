 dicomrt_playmcdose(MCdose,axis,slice,export)

 Create and shows a movie for Monte Carlo 3D dose distribution
 Cumulative segment's contribution along axis 'axis' and for slice 'slice' is shown. 

 Axis is a character and refers to the cartesian axis (X,Y,Z)
 
 Slice refers to the slice where the dose will be shown.

 If export is ~=0 the movie will be exported in avi format with name nameof(MCdose).avi
 If export is omitted the movie will not be exported.

 MCdose must be a cell array containing dose from segments.
 MCdose is a cell arrays with the following structure

   beam name     3d matrix/segment
  --------------------------------------
  | [beam 1] | [1st segment 3dmatrix ] |
  |          | [1st segment 3dmatrix ] |
  |          |                         |
  |          | [nth segment 3dmatrix ] |
  --------------------------------------
  |   ...               ...            |
  --------------------------------------
  | [beam 2] | [1st segment 3dmatrix ] |
  |          | [1st segment 3dmatrix ] |
  |          |                         |
  |          | [nth segment 3dmatrix ] |
  --------------------------------------

 Example:

 [mymovie]=dicomrt_showmcdose(A,'z',5,1)

 store in mymovie a multiframe image which display the sum of the dose
 delivered by each beam segment on slice 5 along z axis and export movie
 to file &quot;mymovie.avi&quot;.

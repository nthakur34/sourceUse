 dicomrt_plotsegments(A)

 if A is the rtplan study for a plan with 3 beams and 1 segment for 1st beam, 2 segments
 for 2nd beam and 3 segments for 3rd beam the command will produce windows with the plots:
 
 window 1: A_b1s1, 
 window 2: A_b2s1, A_b2s2, 
 window 3: A_b3s1, A_b3s2, A_b3s3

 dicomrt_MINcal(inputdose,inputerror,dose_xmesh,dose_ymesh,dose_zmesh,VOI,voi2use)

 Calculate the MIN Dose for a given 3D dose distribution within a given VOI
 
 inputdose is the input 3D dose (e.g. RTPLAN or MC generated)
 inputerror is the relative error asociated with the calculated dose. If inputerror=0 error
 calculation is not performed (e.g. for TPS dose matrices), otherwise
 inputerror dimensions must match those of inputdose (e.g. for MC dose matrices).
 dose_xmesh,dose_ymesh,dose_zmesh are x-y-z coordinates of the center of the dose-pixel 
 
 VOI is a cell array which contain the patients VOIs as read by dicomrt_loadvoi
 voi2use is a vector pointing to the number of VOIs to be used ot the analysis and for the display.

 Example:

 [A]=dicomrt_MINcal(B,0,dose_xmesh,dose_ymesh,dose_zmesh,demo_voi,9);
 
 returns in A the min dose for the dose matrix B and the voi # 9 within demo_voi.

 NOTE: 
 due to the algorithm that MATLAB uses to filter matrices (roipoly), it can happen that 
 some of the voxels which are partially outside the patient are included in the VOI.
 This can happen when the border of the VOI are too close to the patient outline with 
 respect to the size of the calculation matrix used.
 This is not a problem for MC which calculate dose also outside the patient outline.
 It may represent a problem when dealing with TPS generated data, which do not calculate
 dose outside the patient outline, because voxels with zero dose can be counted in the target
 volume. This event is rare (1/10000) and should not influence dose analysis.
 A simple way to overcome this problem is to define VOIs as separate as possible.
 In this function the minimum dose ~=0 is reported.

 dicomrt_CIcal(inputdose,dose_xmesh,dose_ymesh,dose_zmesh,norm,dref,VOI,voi2use)

 Calculate Conformity index for a given 3D dose distribution

 inputdose is the input 3D dose (e.g. RTPLAN or MC generated)
 dose_xmesh,dose_ymesh,dose_zmesh are x-y-z coordinates of the center of the dose-voxel 
 norm is the dose normalization level
 norm =0 (default) no normalization is carried out
      ~=0 doses are normalized to the provided &quot;norm&quot; value (100%)
 dref is the dose level (relative to norm) that will be used for the calculation of the CI 
 VOI is a cell array which contain the patients VOIs as read by dicomrt_loadvoi
 voi2use is a vector pointing to the number of VOIs to be used ot the analysis and for the display.

 Radiation conformity index (RCI - Knoos et al IJROBP 42 1169-1176, 1998) or more simply conformity index (CI -
 IRCU 50 and 62) is defined as the ratio between the volume of the target (Vt) and a volume Vdref.
 Vdref can be the any volume defined by a certain isodose surface &quot;ref&quot; considered clinically relevant 
 (e.g. 95% of the prescribed dose).
 
 CI=Vt/Vdref

 CI is then an increasing function with conformity, reaching unity for a perfect conformal treatment.
 ICRU also specify that the target (or PTV) must be fully enclosed in the Vdref. 
 This is not checked here and this also the limitation of the definition of Konoos etal.
 Another conformity index was defined by van't Riet etal IJROBP (1997) Vol.37 No.3 pp.731-736.
 This function is implemented in dicomrt_CNcal and it not affected by the problem above.
 
 Example:

 [volume_VOI,volume_threshold,conformity_index]=dicomrt_CIcal(A,dose_xmesh,dose_ymesh,dose_zmesh,...
    105,60,demo_voi,9);

 calculates the CI for the dose matrix A and returns it in conformity_index.
 The volumes ot the VOI # 9 and the volume of the isodose volume for 105% (60 Gy = 100%) are also 
 returned into volume_VOI and volume_threshold respectively
 The above call is equavilent to the following:

 [volume_VOI,volume_threshold,conformity_index]=dicomrt_CIcal(A,dose_xmesh,dose_ymesh,dose_zmesh,...
    63,0,demo_voi,9);

function sortingStruct = readLeksellSortingFile(filename)
%"readLeksellSortingFile"
%   Uses the docodeLeksellData function to decode the data from the Leksell
%   files and places the data into a data structure.  However, these values
%   seem to have no significance on the importing of a Leksell plan into
%   CERR, and thus are not used inside of CERR.

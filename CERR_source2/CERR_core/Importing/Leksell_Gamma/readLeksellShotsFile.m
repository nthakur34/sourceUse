function shotsStruct = readLeksellShotsFile(filename)
%"readLeksellShotsFile"
%   Reads a Leksell shots file using decodeLeksellData and places the
%   fields into a datastructure with meaningful names.  Some values are 
%   multiplied by 0.1 to account for the unit change from Leksell (mm) to 
%   CERR (cm).  Many of the values in Leksell files are a mystery at the 
%   moment, and are stored in variables called "mystery_value_x" where x is
%   a number.  If anyone discovers the meaning of these values please 
%   report them on the CERR webpage at radium.wustl.edu/cerr or to 
%   jalaly@radium.wustl.edu. Currently, the shotsStruct.shots data is not 
%   used in CERR.
%
%JRA 6/13/05
%
%LM: KRK, 05/28/07, added additional documentation, newly discovered
%                   variable meanings and scaled mm to cm

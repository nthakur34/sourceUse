function output = decodeLeksellData(fid, startPos, endPos, validFile)
%"decodeLeksellData"
%   Decodes a file exported from the Leksell gamma knife treatment planning
%   system.  This function is recursive, since the fields in the Leksell
%   data are often nested.  startPos is the initial position of the read
%   head.  Leave blank for the initial call.  endPos is the
%   final position of the read head after which no more reading is
%   necessary.  Leave blank for the initial call.
%   Also, all valid Leksell files have the .1 extension, and they always
%   end with a nested array of 2 integers.  These integers seem to have no
%   significance on the importing of a Leksell plan, but among all of the
%   readLeksell<...>File functions one may notice this code:
%
%       data = decodeLeksellData(fid);
%       if length(data) < 2
%           fusionsStruct = [];
%           return;
%       end
%
%   This is to account for the extra cell that contains two integers at the
%   end of the Leksell files.  If the Leksell file is not empty, it
%   must have at least two cells since one of these cells will always be 
%   the two integers. 
%
%   WARNING: Leksell data is big endian.  When getting an fid to be passed 
%   to this function be sure to specifiy big endian to fopen.

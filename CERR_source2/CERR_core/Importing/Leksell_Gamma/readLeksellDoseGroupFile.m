function doseM = readLeksellDoseGroupFile(filename)
%"readLeksellDoseGroupFile"
%   Reads a Leksell dose group file.  Unlike the other readLeksell<...>File
%   functions, the doseGroup file does not use decodeLeksellData, since it
%   appears to be a simple 31x31x31 matrix of single values.  These values
%   are normalized percentages of the maximum dose for each patient.  For
%   example, if the global max in the original dose matrix (the one being 
%   read with this code) is 500, then to find the Gy at each point in the
%   dose matrix, divide the matrix by 500 (giving a percentage
%   value at each point in the matrix) and multiply the matrix by the max
%   dose.  This conversion is done in the importLeksellPlan code because
%   the max dose is indeterminable at this point.

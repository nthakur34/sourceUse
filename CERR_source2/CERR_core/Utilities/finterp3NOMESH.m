function data3M = finterp3NOMESH(xInterpV, yInterpV, zInterpV, field3M, xOrig, yOrig, zOrig)
%"finterp3NOMESHdiv
%   Provides an interface to finterp3 that does not require a meshgrid, but
%   still uses the meshgrid in order to construct slices of the final
%   matrix, using finterp3.  Since only a single slice's mesh exists at any
%   one time, this is more memory efficent than using finterp3.  
%
%   "xInterpV, yInterpV, zInterpV" are the new grid vectors specifying the co-ordinates 
%   for which the dose is interpolated
%
%   "xOrig, yOrig, zOrig" are the x,y,z verctors of the Original dose
%
%   "field3M" is the Array(dose/scan) that is to be interpolated
%   
%   "data3M" is the new Array(dose/scan) after interpolation

%Usage:
%   function data3M = finterp3NOMESH(xInterpV, yInterpV, zInterpV, field3M, xVal, yVal, zVal)

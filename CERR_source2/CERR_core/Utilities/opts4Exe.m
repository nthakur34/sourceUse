function optS = opts4Exe(fileName)
%function optS = opts4Exe(fileName)
%Reads a function which sets fields of a structure array.
%The purpose of this function is to allow compiled stand-alone
%functions to read a user-editable file of option settings.
%This is a compilable command which reads a list of
%commands, one per line, from an ascii file
%which set the structure optsS, e.g.,
%optS.this = 1.
%optS.that = 2.
%optS.word = 'cute'
%This function correctly handles blank lines,
%the function definition line, comment lines,
%comments after assignments, and semicolons.

function planC = copyCERRStructure(structNum, planC)
%"copyCERRStructure"
%   Make a copy of the specified structure, appending it to the end of the
%   structure list.  The new structure takes the name of the original
%   structure, with "Copy of" appended to the front.  The uniformized data
%   of the structure is also created.

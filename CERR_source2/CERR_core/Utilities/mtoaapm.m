function [xAAPM, yAAPM]=mtoaapm(Row, Col, Dims, gridUnits, offset)
%function [xAAPM, yAAPM]=mtoaapm(Row,Col,Dims)  OR (Row,Col,Dims,gridUnits,offset)
%Description: Convert from Matlab-natural matrix coordinates to AAPM format
%coordinates (with origin at the center of the image).
%
%Inputs:
%Row -- A vector of row coordinates
%Col -- A vector of column coordinates
%Dims -- A length-2 vector, giving the numbers of rows first then columns.
%gridUnits -- gives grid units on [y side, x side]
%offset -- gives offset on [y side, x side]
%
%Outputs:
%xAAPM -- x coordinates in AAPM system assuming x = 0 is the midpoint.  (unless offset is provided)
%yAAPM -- y coordinates in AAPM system assuming y = 0 is the midpoint.  (unless offset is provided)
%
%Globals: None.
%
%Storage needed: Twice the size of the (x,y) input vectors.
%
%Internal parameters: None.

function addCERRFigureHandle(handle, name)
%function addCERRFigureHandle(handle, name)
%after creating a new figure within the context of CERR, this function should be called
%so that the program can close the figure if CERR is shut down entirely.
%The handle can also be referenced from any function using global CERRHandlesC.
%-Note that the CloseRequestFcn is modified.  Any changes made to the CloseRequestFcn after this function
% is called should include a call to removeCERRFigureHandle.
%-'name' should be the same as the tag for the figure.

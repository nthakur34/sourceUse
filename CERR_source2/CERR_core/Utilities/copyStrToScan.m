%function planC = copyStrToScan(structNum,scanNum,planC)
%
%This function derives a new structure from structNum which is associated
%to scanNum. The naming convention for this new structure is 
%[structName assoc scanNum]. If structNum is already associated to scanNum,
%the unchanged planC is returned back.

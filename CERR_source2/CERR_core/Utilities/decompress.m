function varargout = decompress(varargin)
%"decompress"
%   Decompresses variables compressed using the compress function, or that
%   are bitstream versions of data compressed with matlab Zip.  Any errors
%   on an individual variable causes the output to be the same as the input for
%   that variable.  See compress for details.

%Usage:
%   individual variable:                   variable = decompress(variable);
%   structure array    : [structureArray.fieldName] = decompress(structureArray.fieldName);
%
%These calls will replace the old data with the new decompressed data.

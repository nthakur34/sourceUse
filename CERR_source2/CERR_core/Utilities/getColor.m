function color = getColor(colorNum, colorArray, mode)
%"getColor"
%   Returns a 3 element RGB colorvector by mapping colorNum into
%   colorArray's rows.  By default if colorNum exceeds the length of
%   colorArray, colorNum loops over and repeats the colors. If 'mode'
%   is set to 'gray' colorNums that exceed the colorArray return gray.
%
%   JRA 1/5/03
%
% Usage:
%   color = getColor(colorNum, colorArray)
%   color = getColor(colorNum, colorArray, 'gray')
%   color = getColor(colorNum, colorArray, 'loop')

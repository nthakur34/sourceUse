function minD = minDistBinned(pts1, pts2, binSize, blockSize);
%"minDistBinned"
%   Returns the minimum distance between two sets of points in n-D space.
%   Points are specified as a matrix size nPts x nDims, ie for 10 points in
%   3 dimensions, 10x3.
%
%   minDistBinned bins the point data in an attempt to throw away a
%   significant number of points.  For two large point sets that are
%   somehwat seperated from each other in space and whose points are not
%   all nearly equidistant from the other surface (concentric cylinders, 
%   spheres, margins) this binning results in significant improvements in
%   calculation time.  
%
%   An optional parameter, binSize, sets the size of the bins.  If not passed, 
%   the default of .5 is used.
%
%   minDistBinned uses minDistBlock for the actual distance calculation.  
%   The optional blockSize parameter to be passed into minDistBlock can be 
%   passed in to this function, if it does not exist no blockSize is passed
%   to minDistBlock and it uses its default (usually 5E6).

function dist = surfDist(numStr1, numStr2, planC, blockSize)
%"surfDist"
%   Returns the minimum distance in cm between the surfaces of two
%   (uniformized) structures in planC.
%
%   blockSize is an optional argument that specifies how many points from
%   the larger set are examined at a time.  If left empty blockSize is
%   determined automatically.

function [surfPoints, planC] = getStructureSurfacePoints(structNum, makeUniform, planC)
%"getStructureSurfacePoints"
%   Return the [row,col,slice] of the surface points of CERR structure
%   <structNum>'s uniformized representation. A surface point is defined 
%   as any voxel in the structure that is adjacent to a voxel not in the 
%   structure.  Two voxels are considered adjacent when their faces touch, 
%   and NOT adjacent if only their corners or edges touch.
%
% 	makeUniform is an optional parameter which determines if the
%   uniformized data should be generated cases where it does not
%   already exist. 'yes' by default.
%         'no'        = do not generate.
%         'yes'       = generate.
%         'prompt'    = ask user if they want to generate.
%
%   planC is an optional parameter.  If it is not passed the global planC
%   is used.
%
%   This function does not use getUniformStr + getSurfacePoints so that it
%   operates as quickly as possible, for use in a beams eye view module.
%
% JRA 03/23/05 - Created this function for Beams Eye View.
%
% Usage:
%   [surfPoints] = getStructureSurfacePoints(structNum)
%   [surfPoints, planC] = getStructureSurfacePoints(structNum, makeUniform, planC)

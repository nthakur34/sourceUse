function [bbox]=boundingBox(targetMask);
%"boundingBox"
%   Fast algorithm to find the bounding box of the binary structure
%   targetMask, in terms of rows, cols, slices.  The bounding box is the
%   minimum sized box that includes all true values in the passed mask.
%
%   bbox has form [rMin rMax cMin cMax sMin sMax].
%
%Usage:
%   [bbox]=boundingBox(targetMask);

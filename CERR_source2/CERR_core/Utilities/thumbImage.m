%OLD (10/17/06): function im = thumbImage(im, ratio)
%"thumbImage"
%   Create a thumbnail of an image, im.  The thumbnail will be reduced in
%   size by ratio, where 2 means a half size thumbnail.  Each pixel in the 
%   thumbnail will be the mean of all pixel values around the corresponding 
%   area in the original.  This has a smoothing effect.

%   JRA 12/31/03
%
% Usage:
%   function im = thumbImage(im, ratio)
%
%This algorithm reshapes the image so that the mean of each column within
%each of NxN subdivisions of the original image can be found.  Then the
%means of these means are found.  These are the mean values for each region
%in the original image and are used as the pixel values in the thumbnail.
%
%LM: APA, 10/17/2006: used finterp2 for interpolating scan on thumbnails.
%LM: APA, 11/06/2006: reverted back to low-pass filter since directly using
%finterp2 gave bad-quality thumbnails. Note that the passed im is such that
%size(im)./ratio is always equal in x and y.

function contour = rasterToPoly(rasterSegments, scanNum, planC)
%"rasterToPoly"
%   Convert a list of raster segments into contours, one slice at a time
%   in order to save memory and increase speed.
%
%   By JRA 10/1/03
%
%   rasterSegments:    List of rasterSegments to convert
%   scanNum       :    Scan number the rasterSegments are associated with.
%   planC         :    the planC
%
%   contour       :    typical CERR contour structure.
%
% Usage:
%   contour = rasterToPoly(rasterSegments, scanNum, planC)

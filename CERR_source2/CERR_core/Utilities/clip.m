function vec_outV = clip(vec_inV,low_limitC,high_limitC,valC);
%"clip"
%   Clips the values to lie between the limits high_limitC and
%   low_limitC.  The clipped values are set equal to valC.
%   If vec_inV is a vector, if valC is set to 'delete',
%   which results in truncation.  If valC is the string 'limits'
%   then the vec is clipped at the limits.
%
%   JOD, inspired by Num Python specs , 
%   LM: 17 Jan 03, to improve speed.
%       11 June 03, JOD, improved speed of limits case.
%       23 Dec 04, JRA, Now replacement value can be explicitly defined.
%
%Usage:
%   vec_outV = clip(vec_inV,low_limitC,high_limitC,valC);

function tagS = frame_of_reference_module_tags
%"frame_of_reference_module_tags"
%   Return the tags used to represent a frame of reference as specified by 
%   C.7.4.1 in PS3.3 of 2006 DICOM specification.
%
%   Tags are returned in a struct array with 3 fields:
%   
%   Tag: String containing hex DICOM tag of a field.
%  Type: String describing type of field, with 5 options:
%         '1' Field must exist, data must exist and be valid.
%         '2' Field must exist, data can exist and be valid, or be NULL.
%         '3' Field is optional, if the field exists data can exist and be
%             valid or be NULL.
%         '1C' Field must exist under certain conditions and contain valid
%             data.
%         '2C' Field must exist under certain conditions and can contain 
%             valid data or be NULL.
%Children: For sequences, a tagS with the same format as this struct array.

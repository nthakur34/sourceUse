function el = export_referenced_rt_plan_sequence(args)
%Subfunction to handle referenced_rt_plan sequences within the
%rt_dose module.  Uses the same layout and principle as the parent
%function.
%
%   This function takes a single CERR doseS from a planC that has had
%   generate_DICOM_UID_Relationships run on it.

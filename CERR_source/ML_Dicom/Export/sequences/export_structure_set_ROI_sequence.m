function el = export_structure_set_ROI_sequence(args)
%"export_structure_set_ROI_sequence"
%   Subfunction to handle structure_set_ROI sequences within the
%   structure_set module.  Uses the same layout and principle as the parent
%   function.
%
%   This function takes a CERR structure element and the index of that
%   element within the planC.structures array.

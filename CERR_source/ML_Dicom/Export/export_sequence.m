function dcmobj = export_sequence(function_handle, el, data)
%"export_sequence"
%   Given a fHandle to function of type export_<whatever>_sequence_field,
%   and the data required to execute that function, performs the required
%   legwork to actually populate each field within a template of the
%   sequence.
%
%   el is the parent element of the sequence template.
%
%   data is the information that is used by individual _field functions to
%   populate the fields.

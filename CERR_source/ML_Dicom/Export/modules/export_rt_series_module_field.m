function el = export_rt_series_module_field(args)
%"export_rt_series_module_field"
%   Given a single planC.dose or planC.structures and a tag in the
%   RT_series module, return a properly populated and formatted instance of
%   that tag.  DICOM specifies that RT series also support RT Plan, RT
%   Record, and RT Image, but these are not currently implemented in CERR
%   and so are not required for export.  They may be implemented in the
%   future.
%
%   For speed, tag must be a decimal representation of the 8 digit
%   hexidecimal DICOM tag desired, ie instead of '00100010', pass
%   hex2dec('00100010');
%
%   Arguments are passed in a structure, arg:
%       arg.tag         = decimal tag of field to fill
%       arg.data        = CERR structure(s) to fill from
%       arg.template    = an empty template of the module created by the
%                         function build_module_template.m
%
%   This function requires arg.data is either a doseS or a structuresS.

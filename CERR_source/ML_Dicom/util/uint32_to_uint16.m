function newData = uint32_to_uint16(data);
%"uint32_to_uint16"
%   Converts a column vector of uint32s to a vector of uint16s that is twice as
%   long but contains the same byte information.
%
%   For example, a vector containing a single uint32, [1000000] would be
%   converted into a vector containing two uint16s, [16960 15], the bitwise
%   equivalent to the original vector.

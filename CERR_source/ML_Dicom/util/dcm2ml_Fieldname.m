function mlName = dcm2ml_Fieldname(dcmName, tag)
%"dcm2ml_Fieldname"
%   Returns a string that is capable of being used as a Matlab struct
%   fieldname, based on the DICOM fieldname string passed in, by replacing
%   or deleting characters such as "-" "/" "(" etc.  
%
%   The original tag value of the corresponding element should be passed in 
%   to handle the case where the fieldname is "?", or unknown.  In this 
%   situation the fieldname returned is "Private_xxxx_xxxx" where the Xs 
%   are the tag values.
%
%   TODO: consider and add any other possible illegal fieldname characters.

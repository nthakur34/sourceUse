function newData = bitstream_conversion_to(datatype, data);
%"bitstream_conversion_to"
%   Converts a column vector of either unsigned int64s, int32s,
%   int16s, or int8s into a vector of a new one of these datatypes,
%   conserving the bit information.  For example, this allows a uint32 
%   vector to be converted into a vector of uint8s with 4 times the
%   elements but the exact same bit order.  
%
%   As another example, a vector containing a single uint32, [1000000] 
%   could be converted into a vector containing two uint16s, [16960 15], 
%   the bitwise equivalent to the original vector.
%
%   Datatype must be one of the following strings: 
%       'uint32', 'uint16', 'uint8'.
%
%   This function was intended for use with the DICOM export module.

function isodoseClosedContour = getBeamCrossSection()
%isodoseClosedContour50 = getBeamCrossSection()
%
%Output: isodoseClosedContour - representation of beam contour
%dimension (3xN). 1st, 2nd and 3rd row represent x, y and z-coords of the
%contour respectively. It is assumed that the ray starts at (0,0,0) and
%moves along +(ve) x-axis. If collimatorType does not match the list, an
%empty isodoseClosedContour50 is returned.

function coll3V = scan2Collimator(scan3V, gantryAngle, couchAngle, collimatorAngle, isocenter, isodistance)
%"scan2Collimator"
%   Convert from scan coordinate system to collimator coordinate system.  The
%   scan system is that of a typical CERR CT, where +Z points in the
%   direction of the patient's head, +X points in the direction of the
%   patient's left side, and +Y points out of the patient's chest.
%
%   scan3V is a matrix whose rows are each x,y,z vectors/points to be converted
%   from the scan coordinate system to the collimator system.
%
%   gantryAngle is the angle of rotation about the Y axis of the ROOM, at
%   isocenter.
%
%   couchAngle is the angle that the table is rotated about the Z axis of
%   the ROOM, also at isocenter.
%
%   collimatorAngle is the angle that the beam limiting device is rotated
%   about the central axis of the beam.
%
%   isocenter is the isocenter position in SCAN coordinates.
%
%   isodistance is the distance from the radiation source to isocenter, in
%   cm.
%
%   coll3V is collimator coordinates, with origin at radiation source.
%   
%   See IEC 1217 for details.
%
%   ALL ANGLES ARE IN RADIANS.

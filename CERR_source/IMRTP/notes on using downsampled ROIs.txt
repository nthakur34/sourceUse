Notes on the problem of using downsampled volumes in the
influence matrix.

How to do it:
-- Getting the downsampled structures can be done using built-in,
already available functions.

-- IMRT planning can proceed using the downsampled volumes without
consideration of the downsampling proper (but the relative volume
needs to be correct).

-- Inflating the dose correctly need only occur at the point of
re-construction into the fully 3-D dose distribution.  If
downsampling is only x-y, this can be done using either
2-D interpolation or a ring-filter (El Naqa).

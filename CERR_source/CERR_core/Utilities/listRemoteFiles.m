function [remoteFiles, planC] = listRemoteFiles(planC, saveFlag)
%"listRemoteFiles"
%   Returns a structure array of variables in planC that are stored 
%   remotely, for the purpose of wrapping these files in the archive
%   when it is saved, as well as updating the remote files.
%
%   If saveFlag is set to 1 or does not exist, the contents of the data
%   field for each remotely stored variable is written to that variable's
%   file.  The variable is then marked as unloaded and returned as part of
%   the modified planC.

function [wordS, start, stop] = word(stringS,n)
%function [wordS start stop] = word(stringS,n)
%Returns the n'th blank delimited word in string of words. n
%must be positive. If there are fewer than n words in the string,
%the null string is returned.  The beginning and ending indices are
%given by 'start' and 'stop'.
%Inspired by the REXX function 'word'.
%
%ex:
%   c=word('a and b',3)

%Get the number of blank-delimited words:

function colorPlot(xV, yV, zV, cV, cmap, style, minVal, maxVal)
%"colorPlot"
%   Plots 2d or 3d point data with each point taking a different color, as
%   defined by the passed colormap.
%
%   xV, yV, and optional zV are the vectors of the x,y,(z) coordinates of
%   points to plot.  If z is not required, set zV to [].
%
%   cV is a value that will be used to index into the colormap, ie a single
%   data value for each x,y,(z).
%
%   cmap, the colormap, is a Nx3 matrix of RGB colors.
%
%   style is a string denoting the vertex style, ie, 'o' or '.' etc.
%
%   minVal/maxVal are the cV values for the first and last colors in cmap,
%   and points will be linearly interpolated along the cmap scale with
%   points lower than minVal or higher than maxVal taking the end colors.
%   minVal and maxVal are optional: if they don't exist the min/max of cV
%   are used.

function planC = validatePlan(planD)
% validatePlan
% Validates the planC after its loaded. This is a necessary step to check
% for old plan files for UID's and also to check for inconsistencies with
% planC. If the plan loaded is for microRT please set "chkMicroRT" field in
% CERROption.m file before using CERR. Default for this field is "0"(Not
% Set)
%
% Usage
%   planC = validatePlan(planC);

function [contour, sliceValues] = maskToPoly(mask, sliceValues, scanNum, planC)
%"maskToPoly"
%   convert a 3D or 2D mask to a set of vertices denoting its contour lines.
%
%   By JRA 10/1/03
%
%   mask       : 2D or 3D matrix to convert
%   sliceValues: vector of CT slice numbers corresponding to each z element in the
%                mask, if mask is one slice sliceValues is just that slice's
%               num.
%   planC      : planC file used to convert from pixel values to real xyz coordinates
%
%   contour    : struct array consisting of segments, one for each slice evaluated.
%   sliceValues: index of slices into coutour, just as the input was.
%
%Usage: [contour, sliceValues] = maskToPoly(mask, sliceValues, planC)

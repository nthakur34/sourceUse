function [scanArraySuperior, isCompress, isRemote] = getScanArraySuperior(scanIndex, planC)
%"getScanArray"
%   Returns the scanArray stored in a planC, in slot scanIndex.  The last
%   returned scanArray is cached in a persistent variable to avoid delays
%   in loading remotely stored or compressed scans.
%
%   If a scan array is compressed it is decompressed before being returned.
%
%   If planC is not passed in, the global planC is used.
%
%   If scanIndex is not valid, or if no valid planC can be found an error is
%   returned.
%
%   isCompress and isRemote are booleans to let the calling function know
%   if the scanArray was compressed and/or remote.

%Usage:

function [assocScansV, relStructNumV] = getStructureAssociatedScan(structsV, planC)
%"getStructureAssociatedScan"
%   Returns a vector with the corresponding associated scan index for each
%   structure number passed in structsV.The structure number passed are
%   checked for associated scan set based on the associated scan UID with
%   that structure number.
%
%   Also returns relStructureNumV, a list of "relative" structure indices for
%   the passed structsV.  This is the number of the structure in the list
%   of all structures with the same associatedScan.
%
%   If planC is not specified, the global planC is used.

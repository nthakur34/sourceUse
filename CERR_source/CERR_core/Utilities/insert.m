function xstring = insert(in,target,n,len,pad)
%function xstring = insert(in,target[,[n][,[len][,pad]]])
%inserts the string 'in', padded to length 'len' into
%the string 'target' after the nth character.  'len'
%must be nonnegative.  If 'n' is negative,
%the position of insertion is with respect to the end
%of the string: -1 is before the last character, -2 is before the
%next to last character, etc.  If 'n' is greater than the length
%of the target string, padding is added before the 'in'
%string also.  The default value for 'n' is 0, which means
%insert before the beginning of the string.
%The default
%value for 'len' is the length of 'in'.  The default
%pad character is the blank.

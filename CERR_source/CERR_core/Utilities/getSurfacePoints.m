function surfPoints = getSurfacePoints(mask3M)
%"getSurfacePoints"
%   Return the [row,col,slice] of surface points in mask3M, where a surface
%   point is defined as any voxel in the structure that is adjacent to a
%   voxel not in the structure.  Two voxels are considered adjacent when
%   their faces touch, and NOT adjacent if only their corners or edges
%   touch.
%
%   To create the 3D surface analog of mask3M use:
%
%   surfPoints = getSurfacePoints(mask3M);
%   surf3M = repmat(logical(0), size(mask3M));
%   for i=1:size(surfPoints,1)
%        surf3M(surfPoints(i,1),surfPoints(i,2), surfPoints(i,3)) = 1;
%   end
%
%   Constructing a 2nd 3D mask the size of mask3M may pose a memory
%   problem, so substituting mask3M for surf3M is a good idea if 
%   mask3M is disposable.

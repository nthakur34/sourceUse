function transM = updateTransRot(operation, val, transM, rotPoint)
%"updateTransM"
%
%   Updates the transformation matrix to include a new rotation or
%   translation.  Operation can be 'xt', 'yt', or 'zt' for translation 
%   in x,y,z or 'xr', 'yr', 'zr' for rotation about x, y, or z-axes.
%
%   Val is the amount of the translation or rotation (in cm/radians).
%
%   If transM is not passed in, it is assumed to be the identity matrix.
%   rotPoint is an optional point to perform the rotation around, and
%   should only be specified when using 'xr' 'yr', and 'zr'.  It is [0 0 0]
%   by default.

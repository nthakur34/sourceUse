function [xVals, yVals, zVals] = getDeformXYZVals(deformStruct)
%"getDeformXYZVals"
%   Returns the x, y, and z values of the cols, rows, and slices of the
%   passed deformStruct.  
%
%   REMINDER: These x,y,z values are the coordinates of the MIDDLE of the
%   voxels of the scan.  They are not the coordinates of the dividers
%   between the voxels.
%
%
% xVals yVals zVals : x,y,z Values for scan deformation grid.
%
% Usage:
%   function [xVals, yVals, zVals] = getDeformXYZVals(deformStruct)

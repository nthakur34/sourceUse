function sq = sepsq(pointsV1, pointsV2)
%"sepsq"
%   Returns the square of the distance between all points in pointsV1 and
%   all points in pointsV2.  Valid for any number of dimensions.  Points
%   must be specified with the dimensions along the rows and the points
%   along columns, IE for a set of 4 points in 3space:
%
%               1 6 4 2
%   pointsV1 =  1 1 4 7
%               1 2 5 7
%
%   This function attempts to use mex_sepsq for speed, failing that it uses
%   Matlab code.

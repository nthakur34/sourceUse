function [data, scale] = convertToType(type, data, scale)
%"convertToType"
%   Convert numeric data to type specified, with scaling.  Type can be 'double',
%   'uint8', 'uint16', 'uint32'.  Scale is the value to multiply data
%   by to return to the true values.  If doubles are requested, scale is
%   always 1, ie. the true values are returned.  If no scale is specified 1
%   is assumed.

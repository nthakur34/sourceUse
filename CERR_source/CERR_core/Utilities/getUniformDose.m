function dA = getUniformDose(doseNum, scanNum, structNum, planC)
%"getUniformDose"
%   Get the dose array corresponding to all points in the uniformized
%   dataset specified by scanNum.  If specified, structNum returns only 
%   the dose inside the specified structure, otherwise the full dose is returned.
%
%   If structNum is specified, scanNum takes the value of the structure's
%   associated scan, regardless of what was passed as scanNum.  A warning
%   is issued as well.
%
%   planC is optional: if it is not passed the global planC is used.

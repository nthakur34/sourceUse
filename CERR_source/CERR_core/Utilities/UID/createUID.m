function UID = createUID(modality)
% createUID
% The UID will be created for Scan, Dose OR Structure based on the
% "command" passed to the function. Command can be "CT" or "DOSE" etc. The
% UID is created based on the following logic.
% Field1 = S (stands for scan )
% Field2 = date (date that UID was created)
% Field3 = Time (Its the instance of plan creation/Merge)
% Field4 = Add a random 3 digit number after milliseconds
%
% Example UID = 'CT.1072006.181516.24'
% Where date is 10/07/2006 and time is 6:15pm (1815 Hours)16 sec and 24
% milliseconds

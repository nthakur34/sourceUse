function varargout = findnearest(vecV, value)
%"findnearest"
%   Returns the index of the value in vecV numerically closest to value.
%
%   If two output arguments are requested, returns both the index of the
%   nearest element above and below the passed value.  If value exactly
%   matches an element in vecV,  or if there is no higher or lower element, 
%   both indHigh and indLow take that index.
%
%   If in any situation two values in vecV match for the min or max value,
%   the first index is returned.

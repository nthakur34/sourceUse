function struct = newCERRStructure(scanSet, planC, colorNum)
%"newCERRStructure"
%   Returns an empty, but valid CERR structure. This includes a null string
%   for the structure name and an appropriately formatted contour field.
%
%   scanSet is the index of the scan to register the new structure to.
%   This cannot be changed later.
%
%   Since structure contours require an item for each slice, a planC with 1+ valid 
%   scanSets must be in memory.

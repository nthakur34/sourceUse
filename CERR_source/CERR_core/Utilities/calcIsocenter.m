function [x,y,z] = calcIsocenter(targetsV, method, planC)
%"calcIsocenter"
%   Returns the isocenter for the structure numbers listed in targetsV
%   using the algorithm specified by method.  Currently all structures in
%   targetsV must be part of the same scanSet.
%
%   The planC argument is optional, only use it if the plan is not loaded
%   globally (ie in CERR).
%
%   Current methods: 
%           'COM' - center of mass of uniformized mask composed of all
%                   structsV
%
%Usage:
%   [x,y,z] = calcIsocenter(structsV, method, planC)
%
%ie.
%   [x,y,z] = calcIsocenter([1 3 4], 'COM', planC);

function out = pad(a, numToPad, list)
%function out = pad(a,list)
%pad a with zeros according to the four values
%in the vector list:
%list(1) gives the number of rows to be preprended,
%list(2) gives the number of rows to be appended,
%list(3) gives the number of columns to be prepended,
%list(4) gives the number of columns to be appended.
%Negative numbers correspond to stripping of columns or rows.
%JOD.
%Latest modifications:
%   7 May 03, JOD, fixed bug if list(2) is negative.
%   20 Jun 03, JRA, added parameter numToPad to make it possible to pad with things other than 0.  Involved changing zeros to ones*numToPad.

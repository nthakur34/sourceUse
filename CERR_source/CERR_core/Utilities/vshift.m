function outV = vshift(inV, shift)
%vshift is a drop-in CERR replacement for wshift, which is
%available only in the wavelet toolbox. vshift, unlike wshift
%handles only the 1-D vector shift case.
%outV = vshift(inV,shift)
%performs a p-circular shift of vector inV.
%The shift p must be an integer, positive for right to left
%shift and negative for left to right shift.
%example: outV = vshift([1,2,3,4],1)
%outV =  2     3     4     1

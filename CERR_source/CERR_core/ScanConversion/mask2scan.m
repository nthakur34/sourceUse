function [segmentsM] = mask2scan(maskM, optS, sliceNum)
%function [segmentsM] = mask2scan(maskM, optS, sliceNum)
%segmentsM holds the mask in 'scan segment' format:
%each row of this 2-D matrix has the elements:
%yValue, xStart, xStop, delta_x (all in AAPM coordinates).
%xStart and xStop are the points at which the filled-in segment
%begins and ends; yValue is the y-value of that row.  delta_x is the
%interval between x values.
%
%Get scan format information:
%
%Starting points for filled segments will be those after diff = 1; stopping points will
%those where diff = -1.  This also works for jutting points (one point
%in the segment).

%LM:  18 Mar 02, JOD;
%Major bug fix: 28 dec 02: Scan row was shifted up one row;
%scan column was shifted to the right one column.  Fixed prior to release
%of version 2 beta, JOD.

function [maskM] = scanPoly(edgeM, optS)
%function [maskM] = scanPoly(edgeM,optS)
%This function takes a list of polygon vertices, polyM,
%and returns a maskM matrix which is a 0-1 mask of
%points interior to the polygon.  The first column of polyM is
%the x vertices (in AAPM coordinates), the second column of polyM
%is the y vertices.  It is assumed that x= 0, y = 0 is the center of the image,
%which must have an even number of rows and columns.
%
%segmentsM holds the mask in 'scan segment' format:
%each row of this 2-D matrix has the elements:
%yvalue, xstart, xstop, deltax (all in AAPM coordinates).
%xstart and xstop are the points at which the filled-in segment
%begins and ends; yvalue is the y-value of that row.  deltax is the
%interval between x values.
%
%Needed option settings are:
%  imageSizeV      = optS.ROIImageSize, = [rows, columns] of resulting mask.
%  xPixelWidth     = optS.ROIxVoxelWidth (in cm),
%  yPixelWidth     = optS.ROIyVoxelWidth (in cm).
%
%The algorithm works by labelling edges as left or right bounding and top or bottom bounding.
%For each edge a point, consisting of one point per scan line, appropriate
%for the edge type (LT, LB, RT, or RB).  Store column indices of points in cell
%associated with that scan line.
%
%The algorithm nearly always includes only pixels whose midpoints are inside the polygon.
%This is typically not done in standard polygon scan algorithms.

%Loop through edges in order, so that bounding and connecting
%rules can be applied.

%Rules for neighboring edges:  in the transition L -> R or R -> L, both edges must
%have points on the same extreme scan line.
%In all other cases, neighboring edges must not share the same scan line.

%For each edge:
%1.  Get x indices.
%2.  Decide where to put points.  For L edges, choose integer x point to the
%right of the x intersection; for R edges choose x integer to the left of the
%intersection.
%3.  Decide whether endpoint point is needed for L->R type transition.
%(Note:  endpoints never overlap with point from last edge unless
%L->R or R->L transition.  This is due to the rule that the bottom edge
%is perturbed upward by epsilon to avoid having two edges have a y intersection
%exactly at a voxel midpoint.)

%If we try to put an endpoint in scanM where an endpoint already exists,
%we follow the rules that (a)  If we have a start and a stop,
%we put a point into maskM and eliminate any points in scanM,
%and (b) if it is the same type we do not modify the entry.

%Two matrices:
%For 'sliver points', i.e. where the scan line starts and stops at the same point,
%we just poke a point into maskM.
%Horizontal lines are also skipped, as they are better handled based on the connecting edges.
%For all start (1) or stop (-1) points, we poke a 1 or -1 into the matrix scanM.
%The final image adds maskM to processed scanM.

%For top bounding line, always take the x point

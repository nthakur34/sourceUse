function targetframeStruct = readLeksellTargetframeFile(filename)
%"readLeksellTargetframeFile"
%   Uses the decodeLeksellData function to read in a Leksell target frame 
%   file.  These values are still completely undetermined, but it seems 
%   they are unnecessary for importing a plan into CERR.

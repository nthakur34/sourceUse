LEKSELL GAMMA PLAN FILE AND IMPORTING DOCUMENTATION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Leksell directory and files description
=======================================
- All Leksell files come in a larger directory known as "Gamma Plans." Most
    of these directories are titled with the patients name or some type of
    identification.
- Inside of the root plan folder there exists numerous other directories,
    for the most part clearly labeled with what the directory contains.
    Example: patientX/Studys contains the information about the studies 
    (or scans) used in the treatment plan.
- Inside of each of these subdirectories are Leksell files, all with the
    file extension .1 (with the exception of the Snapshots, CT, MR, and Logs 
    subdirectories which contain images, to be explained later)  and
    labeled appropriately.  These files, for the most part, are encoded and
    require decryption by the decodeLeksellFile function before they are 
    readable.  However, these files contain no fieldnames, so most of the
    values read from these files had to be verified by comparison to 
    output from the Gamma Knife clinical machine (some have yet to be 
    verified, but these are assumed negligible). See decodeLeksellData.m
    for more information.
- If a directory does not contain .1 files, then it is one of the several
    Leksell image or logs directories.

Specific Leksell subdirectory and file information
==================================================
This is the usual layout of a complete Leksell Gamma Plan (alphabetically):
Note: be aware that not all plans have all of these files, but in order
      for the plan to properly import you must have at least these files
      listed below named properly and in the correct directory (unless 
      noted below).

* The files in these folders are not used for importing a Gamma Plan into
  CERR, so their existence is not mandatory and their names are arbitrary.
  Because of this, specific information about these files will not be
  included here.

PatientX:
    This is the root folder of the entire Gamma Plan.  It usually contains
    the patient's name but it is not required to.

CT:
    This folder contains all CT images that were imported into the original
    Plan on the clinical machine.  The Leksell software on the clinical
    machine converts the CT images from their native format and stores them
    as CT_n__<........>.ima and CT_n__<........>.imh files.  This is a 
    proprietary format specific to Leksell CT and MR images.  The ima files
    contain all pixel information for each image, and the imh files contain
    information about picture dimensions, voxel sizes, slice numbers and 
    thicknesses, etc.  The imh files can be viewed with a text editor for
    more information on what is contained in these.

Fusions:
    Holds information for fusing MR and CT images.  This information is
    only present if a fusion was done on the clinical machine during the
    patient's treatment.

MR:
    The contents of this folder are of the same format as the CT folder,
    but contain MR images used in the Gamma Plan.  The proprietary image
    format (.ima/.imh) is still used; see CT folder description for more 
    information.

Orientations:
    Contains transformation matrices dealing with the orientations of
    the different coordinate systems.

Plugs:
    Contains information about the plugging used (if any) in a patient's
    treatment.  The plugging refers to which holes in the collimator helmet
    will be plugged in order to shape the radiation going to the patient.

Shots:
    Holds information about both the shots of radiation used in the
    patient's treatment as well as information about the dose matrices
    resulting from the radiation shots.

Sortings:
    Contains information about the sorting of MR and CT images.

SRData:
    This folder contains several different types of .1 files.  The 
    DoseGroupn.1 files contain a 31x31x31 matrix of floating point values.
    These values are normalized percentages of the global maximum dose.
    Therefore, to find the dose matrix in terms of Gy (this conversion is
    done while importing a plan into CERR), divide all values in the dose
    matrix by the maximum in the matrix and multiply by the global maximum 
    dose.  The Super.1 file contains information about the dose and isodose
    (including the global max dose), and the Skull.1 file holds all
    information about the geometry of the patient's skull.  The 
    TargetFrame.1 file contains information used during the treatment of
    the patient and has no known use in CERR as of now.

Studyregs:
    Contains information about how the transformation matrices should be
    used (in converting one modality's coordinate system to another, ex:
    MR to Leksell)

Studys:
    Contains the 4x4 transformation matrices that are to be used with the 
    information from the Studyreg.1 file.

Thresholds:
    The files found here only contain one value, but it is 0 in all cases
    currently viewed and the meaning has yet to be discovered.

Volumes:
    Contains all information about contouring done for a patient's
    treatment.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================
Q: Why does the importLeksellPlan.m function read in nearly every file
    from a Gamma Plan using the readLeksell<...>File.m function, but only 
    several structures are actually imported into CERR?
A: Most of the readLeksell<...>File.m functions read in data that is used
    by the Gamma Knife Radiation machine during treatment, and is not 
    currently appropriate to use with CERR.  However, the option is still
    available to output all information in a second variable when using
    importLeksellPlan.m from the command line (see the file for more 
    details).  This is incase anything was overlooked in the most recent
    version of the Leksell Importing code so that it could be easily 
    incorporated into CERR.


Q: I keep seeing code in the readLeksell<...>File.m functions similar to:

    data = decodeLeksellData(fid);
    if length(data) < 2
        ...
        return;
    end

    and/or

    for i = 1:(length(data) - 1)  
        ...
    end
    
    Why isn't the last cell in the cell array (data) being accounted for?
A: This is because any true Leksell .1 file always has a pair of integers
    in a in a cell at the end of a file (after it is decrypted).  This pair
    of integers has no significance on the importing of a Gamma Plan and is
    therefore disregarded in all of the readLeksell<...>File.m functions.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Known Bugs/Potential Problems
=============================
- zValues are negative (they are set in the readLeksellImageset.m
    function; however, modifying these to be positive would require
    changing the transformation matrix in importLeksellPlan.m).  I've
    attempted to change the necessary parameters, but whenever the zValues
    are positive, CERR will not display the images.

- Structures do not show up in CERR unless you switch to CT scans, then go
    back to MR.

- Some contours have non-existent associated slice numbers (ex: there are
    only 60 MR images and 40 CT images, but the slice number for a certain
    contour is 133).  This is because these contours were done on either
    the Leksell coordinate system or the fused MR and CT coordinate system
    and not the usual MR or CT coordinate systems.  The problem is that the
    contours read in from the binary files give x and y values and slice
    numbers but no z value.  For the MR and CT this z value is calculated
    easily because all of the images have associated z values with their 
    slice numbers, but associating z values with coordinate systems other
    than MR and CT seems to be more difficult.
    The information for the contours are in the Volume.1 files, and the
    image fusion information is in Fusion.1 (however, how to use this
    information has not been solved).

- Import log code needs to be written (edit the importLeksellPlan function).

- MR pixel intensity problems.  Contact Divya Khullar for more information.

- The DVH calculations are slightly off from what is produced from the 
    Gamma Knife. 

- There are still several unknown variables read in from the original
    Leksell binary files.  These are called mystery_value_x and are found
    in the various readLeksell<...>File.m functions.  The most important
    values have been solved and are incorporated into CERR, but there may
    be some that could be useful for added functionality with respect to
    the Gamma Knife import to CERR.  However, most of the unknown's seem
    to be not useful and unimportant for importing.

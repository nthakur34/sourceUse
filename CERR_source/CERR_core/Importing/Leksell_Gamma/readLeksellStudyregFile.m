function studyreg = readLeksellStudyregFile(filename)
%"readLeksellStudyregFile"
%   Reads a Leksell studyreg file using decodeLeksellData and places the
%   fields into a datastructure with meaningful names.  This structure
%   shows the meaning of the transformation matrices in the Leksell Study
%   files so that it is clear which modality the matrices are going to and
%   from.  However, this information is not used when importing to CERR
%   because the target modality is always LGP (the Leksell coordinate
%   system).

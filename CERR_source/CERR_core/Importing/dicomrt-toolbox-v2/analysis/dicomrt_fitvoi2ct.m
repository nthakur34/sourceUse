% dicomrt_fitvoi2ct(VOI,zmesh,study)
% 
% Fit VOI Z-location to reference Z-location 
%
% When necessary this operation reduce the number of VOI Z locations so that they match 
% in number and in position to the provided dataset of reference (zmesh).
% 
% study is an optional argument which represents the original diagnostic
% scan dataset. When this is provided, calculations are made using the
% SliceThickness parameter, if originally stored in the DICOM file.

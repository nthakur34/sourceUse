 dicomrt_rename3ddose(oldstring,newstring,what2do,corm)

 Change 3ddose filenames.

 oldstring is the old string that needs to be replaced or that is used to match string (see below)
 newstring is the new string that will be replaced or added 
 what2do is a single character which determines whether or not oldtring will be replaced
    'r' newstring replace oldstring
    'a' oldstring is not replaced, newstring is added to the filename just before the extension (3ddose)
        is this case oldstring is still used to match filename among the 3ddose files in current fir
 corm is a single character which determines weather or not old files will be renamed or copied
    'c' oldfile is copied into newfile
    'm' oldfile is moved (renamed) into newfile

 When MC dose is computed for a water phantom case study (e.g. for dose verification) 
 3ddose files contain the contribution from each segment.
 This information could be used in a study where TPS segment contribution
 needs to be evaluated.
 However the filename of the 3ddose files more likely will need to be changed to 
 suit the new case study filename convention.

 Example:

 dicomrt_rename3ddose('demo2','demo2_v2','r','c')

 find in the current directory the 3ddose filenames which contains the string demo2 
 and create new 3ddose files with the file name demo2_v2*.3ddose. If the dir contains
 the following files: demo2_b1s1.3ddose, demo2_b1s2.3ddose when the command terminates
 the following new files are created demo2_v2_b1s1.3ddose, demo2_v2_b1s2.3ddose.
 If then the following command is given:

 dicomrt_rename3ddose('demo2_v2','_mc_xyz_b1s1','a','m')

 it will move demo2_v2_b1s1.3ddose into demo2_v2_b1s1_mc_xyz_b1s1.3ddose and 
 demo2_v2_b1s2.3ddose into demo2_v2_b1s2_mc_xyz_b1s1.3ddose.

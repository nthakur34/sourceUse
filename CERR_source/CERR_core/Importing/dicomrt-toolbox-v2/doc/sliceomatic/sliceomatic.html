 SLICEOMATIC - Slice and isosurface volume exploration GUI

 SLICEOMATIC(DATA) - Use 3D double matrix DATA as a volume data

 Example:

       [x,y,z] = meshgrid(-2:.2:2, -2:.25:2, -2:.16:2);
       v = x .* exp(-x.^2 - y.^2 - z.^2);
       sliceomatic(v)

 Using SLICEOMATIC with no arguments is equivalent to the above
 example.

 Using the GUI:
 -------------
 The white bars on the top, left, and right allow insertion of
 new slices on the X, Y, and Z planes.  Click in an empty area to
 add a new slice or surface.  Click on a control arrow to add a
 new slice or surface.

 The colored bar at the bottom is used to place and position an
 isosurface.  The color in the bar indicates a position (as seen
 in the slice) where the isosurface will go.

 When the rotate camera button is on, the popup menu will control
 the camera.  Turn off camera rotation in order to get individual
 control over properties of the slices and isosurfaces.

 The defaults menu provides default features of newly created
 slices and surfaces.  The AllSlices menu controls properties of
 all the slices and surfaces in the scene.  Use popup menus on the
 objects themselves, or the control arrows to change indivudual
 properties.

 If the data is very large, a reduced model of the data is created.
 This reduced data set is used for interactivly positioning
 isosurfaces.

 The Colormap popdown controls the currenlty active colormap.
 This map is used to color the slices.  The Alphamap popdown
 controls the alphamap used on the slices.

 Doing Cool Stuff:
 ----------------

 Exploration:
 You can get a quick feel of the current data set by adding a
 slice using the ColorTexture option.  Such a slice can be dragged
 through the data very quickly.

 Highlight an Area:
 If certain values in your data are interesting (very large, very
 small, or very median values) you can use transparency to make
 parts of your slices disappear.  Choose AlphaTexture options from
 the defaults, and sweep some slices across your data.  Use the
 AlphaMap to pick out certain data sets.  The exaple given here
 looks best with the `vdown' alphamap.

 You can also add a contour onto a slice to further extract shapes
 from the data you are exploring.

 Hidden Shapes:
 Use the isosurface control bar to create an isosurface.  Be
 patient with this control.  It often takes a while for the
 surface to be created.  Click and hold the mouse button down
 until the first surface appears.  Drag the surface through the
 values until you get something you like, then let go.  If your
 data set is very large, you will need to wait while the new and
 more accurate isosurface is created.

 Volumes:
 You can simulate a volume object by creating lots of stacked
 slices.  Simply use the proper Alphamap and transparent textures
 to highlight the correct data, and a large stack of slices will
 let you simulate a volume object.

 BUGS:
 ----

 1) Sliceomatic does not use the `slice' command.  All slices are
    created by explicitly extracting data from the volume.  As such,
    only slices at integer values are allowed.

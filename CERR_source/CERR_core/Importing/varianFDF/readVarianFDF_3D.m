function [totalheader,rawdata] = readVarianFDF( path, filename )
%readVarianFDF Read an arbitrary Varian VNMR .FDF file
%  Parses for header info and data, passes them back separately.
%  Header comes back with an array showing the parameters within the header
%  Data comes back as an array of the appropriate type defined by the
%  header (you hope).
%
%  Usage:  [ totalheader,rawdata ] = readVarianFDF( path, filename )

%==============Yoinked from Varian PDF documentation =======================
% The format of an FDF file consists of a header and data:
% • Listing 11 is an example of an FDF header. The header is in ASCII text and its fields
% are defined by a data definition language. Using ASCII text makes it easy to decipher
% the image content and add new fields, and is compatible with the ASCII format of the
% procpar file. The fields in the data header can be in any order except for the magic
% number string, which are the first characters in the header, and the end of header
% character <null>, which must immediately precede the data. The fields have a C-style
% syntax. A correct header can be compiled by the C compiler and should not result in
% any errors.
% • The data portion is binary data described by fields in the header. It is separated from
% the header by a null character.

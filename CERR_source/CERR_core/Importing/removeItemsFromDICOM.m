function planC = removeItemsFromDICOM(planC)
% "removeItemsFromDICOM"
%   Reformats the DICOM planC data structure so that struct arrays
%   consisting of fields Item_1, Item_2, ... Item_n are concatenated 
%   into a struct array 1...n under the same parent.
%   See help condenseFields for details on how this is done.

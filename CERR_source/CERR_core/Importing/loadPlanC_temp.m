function [temp_planC] = loadPlanC_temp(fname,file)
%
%   Load and return a planC given a fullpath filename.  planC is returned as 
%   temp_planC in the case where another planC is already open. The filename can 
%   be a .mat or .mat.bz2 file. Bz2 files are extracted to a temporary .mat
%   file, loaded, and then the temporary .mat file is deleted.

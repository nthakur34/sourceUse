function ans = calc_meanDose(doseBinsLowerPtsV, volsHistV, volumeType)
%Calculate the mean dose for a given DVH
%  The last parameter 'volumeType' is a wash in this function again
%  
%  MODIFICATION ALERT:  THIS FUNCTION IS UTILIZED BY THE DREXLER CODEBASE
%
%  LM: 6 Oct 06, JOD, corrected slight error in not taking middle of dose
%  bin.  Added warning if relative volume not close to one (0.5%
%  tolerance).
%
% Usage: calc_meanDose(doseBinsLowerPtsV, volsHistV)

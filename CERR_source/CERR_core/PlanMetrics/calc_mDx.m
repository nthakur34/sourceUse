function ans = calc_mDx(doseBinsV, volsHistV, percent,tail)
% Returns the mean dose of the upper tail (the hottest (100-x)% of the structure)
% given the DVH data and the parameter percent.
%  
%  MODIFICATION ALERT:  THIS FUNCTION IS UTILIZED BY THE DREXLER CODEBASE
%
%  Created: VHC 4/11/06, based off of calc_Dx code
%  Modified:  IME modified 04/17/06 (added tail parameter)
%             VHC 6/27/06, changed description to be accurate
%
%  Usage: calc_mDx(doseBinsV, volsHistV, percent)

function [dataSet, uniqueSlices] = rasterToMask(rasterSegments, scanNum, planC)
%"rasterToMask"
%   Convert a list of raster segments into a mask with inbetween slices
%   removed. sliceValues indicates the real CT slice number of each mask
%   slice. So if the given rasterSegments are on slices 1 and 50 only, a mask
%   with two slices is returned, and sliceValues is [1 50].

%
%rasterSegments:    List of rasterSegments to convert
%scanNum       :    Scan number rasterSegments are defined on.
%
%mask          :    what else? the mask.
%sliceValues   :    Array of CT values for each slice of mask.
%
%Usage:
%   [mask, sliceValues] = rasterToMask(rasterSegments, scanNum, planC)

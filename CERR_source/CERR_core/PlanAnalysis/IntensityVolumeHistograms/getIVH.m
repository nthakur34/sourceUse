function [scansV, volsV] = getIVH(structNum, scanNum, planC)
%"getDVH"
%   Returns DVH vectors for a specified structure and scan set, where
%   scansV is a vector of scan values at a voxel and volsV is a vector of
%   volumes of the corresponding voxel in scansV.
%
%Latest modifications:  03 Sep 02, JOD; block processing for large structures.
%                       03 Mar 03, JOD; interpolation bugfix.
%                       02 May 03, JOD; fix interpolation bug onto superior and
%                                       inferior scan slices.  Fixed test to see
%                                       if scan slices are irregular in z.
%                       09 May 03, JOD; fixed samplerate bug; previously not
%                                       weighting volumes according to
%                                       optS.ROISampleRate.

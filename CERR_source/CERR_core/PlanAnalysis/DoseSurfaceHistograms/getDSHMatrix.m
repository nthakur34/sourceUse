function [planC, doseBinsV, areaHistV] = getDSHMatrix(planC, structNum, doseNum)
%"getDSHMatrix"
%   Wrapper function to get DSH data.  Use this to get the doseV/areaV
%   vectors used to represent DSH data for a structNum and doseNum.  If the
%   surface points have not previously been calculated they are stored in
%   the planC.

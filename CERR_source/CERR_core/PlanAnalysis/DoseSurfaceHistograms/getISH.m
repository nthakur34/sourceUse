function [scanV, areaV, zV, planC] = getISH(structNum, scanNum, planC)
%"getDSH"
%   Returns DSH vectors for a specified structure and scanNum, where
%   doseV is a vector of dose values at surface points and areaV
%   is a vector of areas of the corresponding point in doseV.  Histogram
%   these points by dose to get a DSH.  Also returns the zValue of each
%   point on the structure.
%
%   If planC is specified as an output argument, any DSH points calculated
%   by getDSH are saved with the appropriate structure.

%JOD.
%LM:  14 Oct 02, JOD.
%     05 May 03, JOD, If surface points were not previously determined, they
%                     are now determined automatically.
%     24 Feb 05, JRA  Changed to use getDoseAt to interpolate doses.  Call
%                     to getDSHPoints also changed.

function [xV, yV, lengthV] = surfacePoints(verM, deltaLim)
%"surfacePoints"
%   This function returns the coordinates of points sampled along the
%   surface of the polygon defined by the verM matrix:
%   xV is x-values in the AAPM coordinate frame,
%   yV is y-values, lengthV is the length of the sample
%   interval along the edge.  This function is used to generate 
%   dose-surface-histograms (DSH's).
%
%   This code works by cycling through the polygon edges, and assigning 
%   each edge at least one point.  If the edge is longer than deltaLim 
%   then points are added along the edge.  The number of points along an 
%   edge is ceil(length/delta), linearly spaced.  Points are sampled as:
%       V--p----p----p----p--V, where V is a vertex and p is a sample point.
%   That is, each sample point is in the middle of an interval.  Intervals 
%   are of different sizes for different edges.

%Usage:
%   [xV, yV, lengthV] = surfacePoints(verM, deltaLim)

%Close the contour if need be.
if any(verM(1,1:2)~=verM(end,1:2))
    verM = [verM; verM(1,:)]
end

xV      = [];
yV      = [];
lengthV = [];

%Cycle through edges:
for i = 1 : size(verM,1) - 1
    x1 = verM(i,1);  x2 = verM(i+1,1);  y1 = verM(i,2); y2 = verM(i + 1,2);
    %Compute length of edge:
    len = ((x1 - x2).^2 + (y1 - y2).^2).^0.5;
    if len ~= 0
        %Num intervals needed:
        ints = ceil(len/deltaLim);  %There will aways be at least one interval/sample point.
        delta = len/ints;  %This is the size of an interval around sample points.
        lambdaV = (1/2 * delta: delta : len - 1/2 * delta) / len;
        tmp_xV = (1-lambdaV) * x1 + lambdaV * x2;
        tmp_yV = (1-lambdaV) * y1 + lambdaV * y2;
        xV = [xV; tmp_xV(:)];
        yV = [yV; tmp_yV(:)];

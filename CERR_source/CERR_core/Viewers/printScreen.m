% Print CERR screen

% Shunde 7/14/05

% 24 Apr 2006 KU  Changed to 'print' (with no UI controls) instead of printpreview because of bug(?) in
%                 Matlab 7.2.  Printpreview hangs up if figure is in fullscreen mode.  Maybe try
%                 printpreview again in future version??
% 27 Dec 2006 KU  Switched back to zbuffer for CERR 3.0.
